    "Finally, pick the upward-stabilizing controller that turned out best so far, and now try to improve it manually by fine-tuning its parameters. You can do this by tuning the elements of $K$ directly (what are their physical interpretations?) or by moving the pole locations and re-doing the pole placement. In general, the faster the closed loop poles, the better control performance as long as the model matches reality well. If there is a mis-match, too fast poles will typically result in poorer performace. There is thus a trade-off decided by the quality of the model."
