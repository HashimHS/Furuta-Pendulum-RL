The Furuta Pendulum is a type of inverted pendulum, the control of which is a classic control theory problem in robotics and engineering. It consists of a pendulum arm that can rotate in the vertical plane, a joint section which connects the arm and the base, and a motorized rotary base that can rotate the pendulum base in the horizontal plane.

The goal of this project is to balance the Furuta Pendulum upward using various learning techniques and to compare the results.
